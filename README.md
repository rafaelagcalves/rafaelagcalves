### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a lover of Computer Science. This passion has led me to seek education in subjects such as web development, IT and object oriented programming, amongst other things. 

Previously, I worked as an air hostess. It was a great experience, but I felt like I needed a change in my professional life. 

I am currently studying at 4Geeks Academy to become a Full-Stack developer and pursue my dream job. I am always eager to learn more. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT, PYTHON, FLASK and MySQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects.
