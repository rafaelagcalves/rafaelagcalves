### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a lover of Computer Science. This passion has led me to seek education in subjects such as web development, IT and object oriented programming, amongst other things. 
Previously, I worked as an air hostess. It was a great experience, but I felt like I needed a change in my professional life. I am currently studying at 4Geeks Academy to become a Full-Stack developer and pursue my dream job. I am always eager to learn more.
