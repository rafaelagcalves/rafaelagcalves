<h1>### Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> </h1>

<h3> I am a lover of Computer Science. This passion has led me to seek education in subjects such as web development, IT and object oriented programming, amongst other things. 

Previously, I worked as an air hostess. It was a great experience, but I felt like I needed a change in my professional life. 

I am currently studying at 4Geeks Academy to become a Full-Stack developer and pursue my dream job. I am always eager to learn more. </h3>

<h3> ### 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT, PYTHON, FLASK and MySQL.
     ### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects.
